# structquery
Query data structures using string path in Go

**Note: This project is incomplete, not stable, and most features don't work. I am not working on it at the moment. I am shelving it for work later.**

Using an Xpath-like query language to get, add, remove, or replace values in a Go data structure. Great for dynamic data structures.
